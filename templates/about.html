<p>This site is a (we hope) more useable version of the job listing site at
    <a href="https://careers.ottawa.ca/extjobsearch?sap-language=EN#">careers.ottawa.ca</a>,
    You can use this site to search the City of Ottawa career listings, which are
    updated daily and are always up-to-date with the ones found on the City website.
    The links to Apply to a listing will take you directly to the City of Ottawa
    application for that listing.
</p>

<p>This site has been made possible because the City of Ottawa releases their
    job listings as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">Open Data</a>.
    That data can be found <a href="http://data.ottawa.ca/dataset/job-opportunities">here</a>
</p>

<p>The source code for this site can be found on <a href="">Github</a>
